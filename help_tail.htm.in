<!-- This file is appended to help.html after the options table.
     The options table is auto-generated using the code the also
     generates the options parsing code in Quickplot.  That keeps
     the docs consistant with the code and vis versa.  This is
     not like Doxygen or GTK-doc.
 -->

<p>For example the command
</p>

<pre>quickplot file0.txt file1.wav file2.csv file3.dat</pre>

<p>
will make four graphs in four tabs in one main window.
</p>

<p>The command</p>

<pre>quickplot file0.txt file1.wav file2.csv --new-window file3.dat --no-new-window</pre>

<p>
will make two windows with two graphs in each window.&nbsp; You see: file1.wav will be
forced to be graphed when the parser hits the argument file2.csv, and
file2.csv will be forced to be graphed when the parser hits the
file3.dat argument, at which time the <span class=code>--new-window</span>
is in effect which causes a new window to be used for file2.csv.&nbsp;
file3.dat will be graphed in the same window as file2.csv because the
<span class=code>--new-window</span> option is not longer in effect
when file3.dat is forced to be graphed at the end of the command line.
</p>



<p>The command</p>

<pre>quickplot load1.txt --no-grid --no-lines load2.txt --lines=y --line-width=9 -F</pre>

<p>
will make a graph from data in file load1.txt with no connecting lines
and no grid.&nbsp; It will make a graph from the data in load2.txt
with lines with width 9 pixels and no grid.&nbsp;
The main window displayed will not be full screen since the
<span class=code>-F</span> option was given after the main window
would have been created.&nbsp;
The two graphs will be in two different tab pages in the one main window.
</p>

<p>The command</p>

<pre>quickplot --fullscreen --no-gui load1.txt --default-graph --gui --no-buttons --no-fullscreen --geometry=400x400-0+0 --new-window --graph "0 1" --geometry=400x400+0-0 load2.txt --background-color='rgba(140,140,200,0.6)' --cairo-draw</pre>

<p>
will make main window with a graph in full screen without GUIs, another smaller main window
with the same plot in the top right corner with GUIs except for the buttons bar,
and another small main window in the bottom left corner with a default graph of
the file <span class=code>load2.txt</span> drawn with Cairo with a translucent blueish
gray background.&nbsp;
The main windows are made when they have to be, which at the
<span class=code>--default-graph</span>, <span class=code>--graph "0 1"</span>, and
at the end of the command line when for the default graph of the file
<span class=code>load2.txt</span> must be displayed.&nbsp;
Notice all the graphs are made in a new main window.&nbsp;
That's because the <span class=code>--new-window</span> flag
was set and is not unset as it could be with the <span class=code>--no-new-window</span>
command.
</p>

<p>The command</p>

<pre>echo -e "graph zoom 2 1 -.5 0\ninput `tty`\n" | quickplot /usr/share/tuxpaint/sounds/areyousure.wav --shell --no-gui --no-pipe</pre>

<p>
will graph the tuxpaint areyousure.wav file with
the view zoomed to the right half of the graph.&nbsp;
If you ran this from a bash (or tcsh) shell with a tty,
Quickplot program will connect a Quickplot shell
to the tty and give you an interactive Quickplot
shell after running the <span class=code>input tty</span>
command.&nbsp;  The <span class=code>--no-pipe</span>
option keeps Quickplot from reading the standard
input as graph data so that it can be read by the Quickplot
shell.&nbsp;  
The Quickplot shell will be started after all the command
line arguments are applied, so the shell command
<span class=code>graph zoom 2 1 -.5 0</span> is applied
to the graph that is showing after the all the
command line arguments are processed.&nbsp;
Type <span class=code>help</span> at the Quickplot shell
prompt.&nbsp;
If you would like Quickplot
to save your Quickplot shell history between sessions
just create a <span class=code>.quickplot_history</span>
in your home directory with a command like
<span class=code>`touch ~/.quickplot_history'</span>.

<h3>GTK+ OPTIONS</h3>


<p>
The following GTK+ options are parsed by
the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> APIs (application
programming interfaces), which Quickplot uses:
