The order of argument options matters.  Options take effect
in the order that they are given with later options overriding
earlier ones.  The options that cause actions like graph "something"
must come after the option that says to read the file that has
"something" in it.  In general, the order of argument options gives
the order in which things happen as Quickplot starts up.
