Quickplot Home-page: http://quickplot.sourceforge.net/

The Quickplot home page contains the lastest Quickplot
documentation.   This Quickplot "home page" documentation
is also part of the Quickplot source.  This README file
is just a brief introduction to Quickplot.


What is Quickplot?

Quickplot is an interactive 2D plotter.  You can very
quickly swim through data with Quickplot.

Quickplot is GPL(v3) free software.


The Quickplot source package installs HTML files, man pages
and text files that document Quickplot.


Quickplot is a standard GNU Autotools built package
run:

  ./configure
  make
  make install


or run:

  ./configure --help

for a long list of configuration options.



See http://quickplot.sourceforge.net/about.html for
Installation prerequisites and other details.



There is another optional Quickplot package for development and testing
the Quickplot source code.  Test/junk programs in this package do things
like: display the default Quickplot point and line colors in one window,
or stupid things like read and print "NAN" as a double; just so developers
know.  You can get this "quickplot_tests" package by:

  svn co\
    https://quickplot.svn.sf.net/svnroot/quickplot/quickplot_tests\
    quickplot_tests


Running the above line will make the directory quickplot_tests in the
current directory.


If you are building Quickplot from the GitHub repository source files,
when you run configure you must use the --enable-developer option
to enable the building of addition files that are in tarball
distributions, but not in the git repository.  For example run:

	./bootstrap
        ./configure --prefix /home/joe/installed/encap/quickplot \
          --enable-developer  --enable-debug
        make -j5
	make install



TODO: Add --enable-developer=auto to be the default
